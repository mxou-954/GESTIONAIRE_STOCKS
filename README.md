                        🔹 Installation & Setup
                                  
                            1️⃣ Clone the repository     
                            2️⃣ git clone https://github.com/mxou-954/GESTIONAIRE_STOCKS.git   
                            3️⃣ Open the project in Qt Creator                                           
                            4️⃣ Load all files from the cloned repository   
                            5️⃣ Select CMakeLists.txt (since there is no .pro file)    
                            6️⃣ Compile & Run

                                  
                                  
                        ⚠️ Make sure the correct MSVC Kit is selected
                                  
                        ⚠️ Click on Build & Run
                                  
                        ⚠️ The SQLite database should be accessible in the build directory
                                  
                        ⚠️ Note: If the build directory is not created automatically, ensure Qt Creator is correctly set up to generate it.

                            The project uses SQLite for data storage.
